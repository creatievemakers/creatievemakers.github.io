        Sense Adapt Create: Using Mixed Realities to Explore
        Augmented Collaborations
    </p>
    
    <p class="text">
        Today’s increasingly connected and complex world,
        requires attitudes, entrepreneurial skills, and knowledge
        that transcend individual disciplines. This Summer School
        will provide an interdisciplinary platform for students to
        acquire the necessary skills by adapting STEAM (Science,
        Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics) principles.
        <br><br>
        Students from Engineering, Architecture, and Arts,
        will enhance their skillset by collaborating on a joint
        and multidisciplinary project. In architecture, arts and
        engineering, meeting in physical space for brainstorming
        and design ideation is essential for collaboration. Walls,
        tables, pens and paper are surfaces for exchanging and
        testing design ideas. A number of digital tools increasingly
        support similar processes of collaboration, as we all have
        learned through the recent covid 19 pandemic. These digital
        tools also provide benefits for capturing and streamlining
        design processes, such as exploring design variations,
        and version tracking, and allow for shared authorship.
        parametric modelling and computational design are used to
        generate variations of structures, evaluate and evolve, and
        collaboratively make a selection of structures to be realised
        as scale 1:1 installations. Rather than using plans and
        sections, Augmented Reality is deployed to project a digital
        model of the final structure and the overlaying metadata with
        instructions on how to assemble it. Through 3D scanning
        and sensors, it can continually be measured how the
        physical structures differentiate from the digital model and
        adapt either if necessary.

        On different locations in and aroud Ghent. Amongst others:
        Kasteel “Ter Beken”, Mariakerke; Campus Sint-Lucas,
        Ghent and Ghent Technology Campus. Accomodation for

    <div id="outcome" style="font-weight: bolder;">Application and Deadlines</div>
    <br>
    <p class="text">
        Eligible for participation are all (international) 3th Bachelors
        or Master students in the fields of Architecture, Urban
        Design, Arts and Engineering, as well as young reseachers
    and recent graduates coming from the aforementioned
    fields.
    <br><br>
    Deadline for application: May 14th 2023 <br>
    Confirmation of acceptance: June 5th 2023 <br>
    Interested candidates should send their CV, a motivation <br>
    letter (maximum 300 words in English), including a link to a
    portfolio (if relevant) to: summerschool@creativemakers.xyz
</p>


<div id="outcome" style="font-weight: bolder;">Fee</div>
<br>
<p class="text">
    Students enrolled in programmes at participating universities
    pay a reduced registration fee of 50 EUR that will be
    refunded after show-up. <br>
    Fee for other participants from outside the participation
    institutions: 250 EUR (including lunches and accomodation).
    The participation fee is paid only when the registration is
    approved.
</p>


<div id="outcome" style="font-weight: bolder;">Certification</div>
<br>
<p class="text">
    All participants receive a certificate of participation (3 ECTS
    credits). Students of the Faculty of Architecture and Faculty
    of Engineering Technology validate participation in the
    follow-up track via respectively the elective ‘Participation in
    International Projects’ and ‘Creative Makers’ in the following
    semester. <br><br>
    
    Overall, by participation one will learn to collaborate with other disciplines and achieve some particular skills such as: <br><br>
    • using various emerging technologies to preceive, sense and interact with enviornements <br>
    • processing data through integrating it within creative processes <br>
    • working with time-based media <br> <br>
    The Summer School frames within a broader project called “Creative Makers”, which aims to connect different creative disciplinces through emerging technologies. As such, learning results from interdisciplinary cocreating, discussing and reflecting. As we are committed to making this a long-term initiative and organising this Summer School annually, next to several other multidisciplinary initiatives (e.g. invited guest lecturers, elective course, etc.), to establish STEAM learning within each of the involved disciplines.
