        <p>As “creating and making” plays a central in architecture, engineering and arts: whether it is practice of drawing, painting, sculpting, modelling, coding, prototyping, visualizing… creative work progresses through the iterative process making. The summer school invites students and practitioners form all creative disciplines to join, bringing with them their own skills and expertise. The summer school will introduce students into working with advanced technologies such as sensors, data visualization and dramatization and animation, we will use them to create a narrative in the format of an animation or video. We will provide a framework and workflow that allow students with different degrees in technological, spatial and artistic knowhow to learn and contribute to the project.</p>
        
        <p>>>> We will produce a narrative that reveals hidden layers of our environment and highlights how technology allows us to sense our environments differently.</p>
