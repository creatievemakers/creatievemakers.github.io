<h2>Gilles Callebaut</h2>
<p>Gilles received the M.Sc. degree in engineering technology from KU Leuven, Belgium in 2016. In 2021, he obtained a PhD degree in engineering technology from KU Leuven, where he studied single and multi-antenna technologies to reduce the energy expenditure of IoT devices. He is currently a member of dramco, a research group covering a broad range of research topics in wireless, mobile and embedded communication. He initiated the well-received tutorial “Low Power Wireless Technologies for Connecting Embedded Sensors in the IoT: A Journey From Fundamentals to Hands-on.” His main interests are Machine Type Communication (MTC), Internet of Things (IoT), low-power embedded systems and everything mobile.</p>

<h2>Kasper Jordaens</h2>
<p>
    Before smashing bits together and hacking APIs to whip up prototypes for second screen apps, Kasper Jordaens (°1981) worked for the artist Wim Delvoye to make contemporary art sculptures using his favorite tools: a computer and his creativity. During 5 years of exploring computer technology there, he evolved from an engineer architect into an Internet technologist. In 2009 VRT-medialab licensed him to experiment with new technology. There he helped moving the second screen into the real-time era and contribute concepts and technology to the public broadcaster. iMinds MiX was a continuation as well a whole new lab that needed to be bootstrapped. Kasper used this opportunity to help define the first projects in the new Media Innovation Center. After putting forward a new lab in ‘de krook’, a public building in the center of Ghent, Kasper worked as a solution designer and ICON innovation manager for imec. Right now Kasper is focusing his energy on the new polymath lab at LUCA school of arts. It’s a hub connecting research, education and industry in the broad context of art and topics like immersive and AI.

<h2>Liselotte Vroman</h2>   
<p>
    Liselotte Vroman (b.1986) obtained her Masters in Architecture in 2010 at the KU Leuven Faculty of Architecture campus Brussels. After graduating she worked as an independent architect for a period of 5 years (2010 -2015). In 2016 she has started her PhD project Generating a better understanding of the effect of spatial qualities on the embodied experience in (semi-) public spaces: reconsidering the design process by examining human motion. Central to her research is the relationship between human and space, which she conceives as a key concept within the field of Architecture.
