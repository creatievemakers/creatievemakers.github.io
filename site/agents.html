<p>
    Liselotte Vroman is an architect and postdoctoral researcher at the Faculty of Architecture of KU Leuven. She obtained her Master's degree in Architecture in 2010 from the Hogeschool voor Wetenschap en Kunst, Sint-Lucas Brussels. After graduating, she worked as an independent architect for 5 years (2010 -2015). In the summer of 2021, she completed her interdisciplinary doctoral project entitled "Make Room for Play; Questioning the Role of the Moving Body between Thinking and Making". She is involved in several interdisciplinary projects. As a member of the research group "The Drawing and The Space", she studies creative processes and the role of drawing within those processes. Moreover, she gives several practical courses and workshops on the sensory body.

<p>
    Before smashing bits together and hacking APIs to whip up prototypes for second screen apps, Kasper Jordaens (°1981) worked for the artist Wim Delvoye to make contemporary art sculptures using his favorite tools: a computer and his creativity. During 5 years of exploring computer technology there, he evolved from an engineer architect into an Internet technologist. In 2009 VRT-medialab licensed him to experiment with new technology. There he helped moving the second screen into the real-time era and contribute concepts and technology to the public broadcaster. iMinds MiX was a continuation as well a whole new lab that needed to be bootstrapped. Kasper used this opportunity to help define the first projects in the new Media Innovation Center. After putting forward a new lab in ‘de krook’, a public building in the center of Ghent, Kasper worked as a solution designer and ICON innovation manager for imec. Right now Kasper is focusing his energy on the new polymath lab at LUCA school of arts. It’s a hub connecting research, education and industry in the broad context of art and topics like immersive and AI.

<p>
    Weronika Gajda is an architect and engineer. In 2021, she obtained her Master's degree at the Faculty of Architecture, KuLeuven. With her master thesis, she explored the role of media ecologies in public space/sphere in Warsaw during protests in Poland in 2020. Since march 2022, she has been conducting interdisciplinary PhD research in the Faculty of Architecture and the Faculty of Engineering Technology, KULeuven in Gent. She is engaged in collaborations between different disciplines, trying to establish a common ground in research and design practice related to communication technologies. In her work, she continues mapping public space through 3D modelling, photogrammetry, scraping, and people's engagement in co-creating collective experiences. She investigates the impact of internet infrastructure on architecture and public life on different scales, from individual use of smartphone devices to digitized representations of cities.
