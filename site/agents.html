<h2>Gilles Callebaut</h2>
<p>Gilles received the M.Sc. degree in engineering technology from KU Leuven, Belgium in 2016. In 2021, he obtained a PhD degree in engineering technology from KU Leuven, where he studied single and multi-antenna technologies to reduce the energy expenditure of IoT devices. He is currently a member of dramco, a research group covering a broad range of research topics in wireless, mobile and embedded communication. He initiated the well-received tutorial “Low Power Wireless Technologies for Connecting Embedded Sensors in the IoT: A Journey From Fundamentals to Hands-on.” His main interests are Machine Type Communication (MTC), Internet of Things (IoT), low-power embedded systems and everything mobile.</p>
